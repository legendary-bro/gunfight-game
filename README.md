Gun fight is my clone of the eponymous 1975 arcade title by Midway Games.  
While little known, the original boasted some impressive firsts.
  
Chiefly:  
* The first game to use a CPU
* The first game to have a soundtrack
* The first game to depict human on human violence
* The first game with terrain deformation
  
The game is built entirely on the excellent <a href="http://www.phaser.io/">Phaser</a> game framework.  
Enjoy!
